=head1 NAME

PDL::R::math - routines from statistics language, R,  for PDL

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module provides access to many of the statistical functions
available in the nmath library of the R statistical language.

It is assumed that users of this library are already familar with the
R language. The documentation will be sparse and where appropriate
will focus on the differences between pure R and PDL:R.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use PDL::R::math;

=head1 CALLING CONVENTIONS

A key point in understanding PDL::R is that the calling convention for
functions is slightly different than pure R.  

Specifically there are no implicit or default values for functions,
nor does PDL::R support named parameters.  [Though this may change
at a later date...]

For example in R the documentation for the dunif functions is:

   dunif(x, min=0, max=1, log=FALSE)   # Pure R

Which would allow for dunif to be called from pure R as:

   dunif(x)                        # Pure R, default values
   dunif(x,0,5,0)                  # Pure R, all values defined
   dunif(x,max=10,min=0,log=TRUE)  # Pure R, named parameters

In PDL::R, you *must* specify *all* of the parameters in the order
they are defined in the documentation.

The functions above would be written in PDL::R as:

   dunif(x,0,1,0)     # PDL::R, specifying all parameters
   dunif(x,0,5,0)     # PDL::R, specifying all parameters
   dunif(x,0,10,1)    # PDL::R, no named parameters
