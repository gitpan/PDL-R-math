In order to build this module you need to build the source for R. I have
been using R version 1.3 but I think anything above 1.2 is probably ok.

Source for R can be obtained at www.r-project.org


Steps To Build
--------------
0. Build & install PDL::NamedArgs
1. Build R (ie. ./configure; make)
2. Build R nmath standalone
   cd <to wherever the root of the R source code is>
   cd src/nmath/standalone
   make
3. Edit the Makefile.PL to set the Rlocation variable
   to the path to the R source code root.
4. perl Makefile.PL
5. make
6. perl testPDL.pl
7. make install
8. Have fun....
