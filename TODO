Lots of stuff TODO
==================
- Add some type of error conditions using carp/croak/die
  for invalid arguments
- Support namedargs for the r<dist> functions
- Write a perl hack to automatically extract docs for functions
  from R and generate DOCS section for ppdef
- Work with the R project to see if the library can be built such
  that both projects can share the same *.so file.
- Create PDL::R as a basic container class
- Create PDL::R::funcs to support translated R functions
  probably using PDL::Autoload


Wishlist Items
==============
- Utilize the BadCode section to provide BAD support.
- Translate some of the *.R functions into perl.  Im especially 
  interested in glm.  If someone wants to volunteer that would
  be EXCELLENT!!
- Develop PDL::Graphics::R to support R's builtin graphics


Recently Completed
==================
- Utilize the PMCode sections and write Perl wrappers to handle
  variable argument passing with defaults that match R
- Make the pars arguments mimic the names of the R arguments
- Write ppdefs for all the r<distribution> functions that I
  omittied first time thru
- Ensure that all functions are returning doubles even if they
  are passed ints.  (This causes problems with the beta function
  etc)
- Fix the PPCode sections to fix the calling order & perform
  arithmetic operations for ptukey, qtukey, besselI, besselJ,
  dexp, pexp, & qexp to match the R defaults
