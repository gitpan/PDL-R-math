My first attempt at an PDL::R module. This module exports the
mathematical functions provided in the src/nmath/standalone directory of
the R source code.

This module depends on another of my modules PDL::NamedArgs.


Usage

   use PDL::R::math


You can look at rmath.pod for some documentation (though its not fully
up to date) and you can look at the code in rmath_auto.pd is see what
functions are available.

Alternatively you can look at the code in testPDL.pl which exercises all
of the functions provided in this library.
